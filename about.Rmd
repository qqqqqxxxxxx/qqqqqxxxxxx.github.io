# This page has information about me

I was born in Shandong, China. In 2015, I attended Shanghai Jiao Tong University and majored in Food Hygiene and Nutrition. 

In 2017, I came to the US. I went to undergraduate school at Cornell, majoring in Nutritional Sciences and minoring in Applied Economics. 

After graduating from Cornell in 2019, I came to Columbia for my graduate study in Biostatistics. Currently I work part-time in Seres Lab and help with data analysis. I am expected to graduate in May 2020.
